Hi.  I'm Akhil. I am a cofounder of QU3ST, as Web3 start up.

Previously, I researched computational, mathematical and physical models to _predict_ __protein-protein interactions__
and _improve_ __rational drug design__ with the [Applied BioComputation Group](https://abcgroup.cluspro.org).

I have worked at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/) and the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/), where I
managed many __intellectual property (IP)__ activities, from preparation and prosecution of patents to creating 
new internal IP policies and guidelines.

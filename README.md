Hi.  I'm Akhil. I am a cofounder of QU3ST, a Web3 start up.

In [grad school](https://abcgroup.cluspro.org) I [researched](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=9JvwM2UAAAAJ) rational drug design. We developed ML+physics models to understand proteins and their interactions with small-molecules and other proteins.

As an engineer at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/), I prepared (and prosecuted) patents and later did an [ORISE](https://orise.orau.gov/) fellowship at the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/).
